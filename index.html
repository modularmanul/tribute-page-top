                is one of those <em>What I wish I had when I was learning</em>
                resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science
                education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and
                neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is
                designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it
                on their own but still want a high quality education.
